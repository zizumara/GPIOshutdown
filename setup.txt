GPIOshutdown Service Installation Instructions

These instructions assume that GPIOshutdown.py is located in /home/pi.  If you want to use
a different directory for the Python script, be sure to edit GPIOshutdown.sh to point to 
this directory.

1. Copy GPIOshutdown.sh to directory /usr/local/bin.

2. Make sure GPIOshutdown.sh is executable with

      sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/GPIOshutdown.sh

3. Copy GPIOshutdown.service to directory /lib/systemd/system.

4. Use the following to enable the service on startup.

      sudo systemctl enable GPIOshutdown
      
5. To check status after startup, use

      sudo systemctl status GPIOshutdown
   
   This should display status showing that GPIOshutdown.service is loaded and 
   the status is "active (running)".
